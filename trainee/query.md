## **Postgres_SET_4:**




1.**create a csv file with sample data like below with 10 to 20 records
emp_id |     name      | dept_id | mgr_id | salary | joining_date | termination_date | mgr_name**
--------+---------------+---------+--------+--------+--------------+------------------+----------
      1 | Harish        |         |        |  90000 | 1990-12-17   | 2015-12-17       |

**2. Load the csv to table using psql command**

```
psql -h 172.17.10.109 -U python_app -d training -c "\copy employee (emp_id,name,dept_id,mgr_id,salary,joining_date,termination_date) FROM 'Downloads/sql4.csv' with (format csv,header true, delimiter ',');"
```


3. **While loading the table, if the given mgr_id is not in emp table, insert/update should fail**

```
ALTER TABLE employee
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_employee_Code FOREIGN KEY (mgr_id)
REFERENCES employee (emp_id) ;
```
```
ALTER TABLE employee
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_dept_code FOREIGN KEY (dept_id)
REFERENCES dept (dept_id) ;
```

4.**While loading the table, if the given dept_id is not in dept table, we should insert a record in dept table first with id and name as dept_id in the csv and then insert the employee table**
#### Triggers
* INSERT
* BEFORE
* AFTER
* UPDATE
* DELETE


5. **create a new employee table (say employee1) with the same structure and constraints of employee table but not data**

``` 
CREATE TABLE employee1
AS
 SELECT * FROM employee
 WHERE 1=0;
```
```
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-createtable.html
```
6.**add a new column peer_emp_ids array**
```
ALTER TABLE employee1 ADD COLUMN peer_emp_ids int[];
```
7.**write an insert statement to populate this table from employee table where peer_emp_ids is the employee ids of its manager excluding the given employee**
```
insert into employee1
SELECT
	*, (
		SELECT
			ARRAY_AGG (emp_id)
		FROM
			employee e_inr
		WHERE
			e_inr.mgr_id = e.mgr_id
	) - ARRAY [ e.emp_id ]
FROM
	employee e
```
8. **Write a SQL to find all the employees for the given employee id where the given employee is part of using peer_emp_ids**
```
SELECT  *  FROM
	employee e
INNER JOIN employee1 e1 ON e.emp_id = ANY (e1.peer_emp_ids)
WHERE
	e1.emp_id = 3
```
* 9.Write an anonymous block which will do the below steps
* 9a. Create employee_bulk table with same struct as employee table
* 9b. select all from employee table and append id + 100 and name-<iteration #>, * salary plus random addition of 1000 to 10000 and joining date plus/minus random * days of 1 to 1000 days, flip/set termination date to null at a probability of 10%, and then insert into employee_bulk table
* 9c. Repeat 9b 2 times
